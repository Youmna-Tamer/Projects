This project aims to build a full machine learning pipeline that predicts whether a hotel booking will be 
canceled or not. Students are required to perform data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), 
feature engineering, model building, feature selection, and performance evaluation. 
The target variable for prediction is is_canceled.
